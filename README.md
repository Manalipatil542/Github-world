My first repository on GitHub
I enjoy drawing and sketching. I soon came to appreciate the benefit of being able to practice my skill wherever and whenever I pleased. When I have leisure time, I like to draw. I've always drawn, even as a little child. When I originally wanted to start drawing, I was powerless to stop myself from buying some pencils and sketchbooks.  I think it will always be a part of me since I was so fascinated by the connection and happiness I experienced when I first used the pencil in that journal.
